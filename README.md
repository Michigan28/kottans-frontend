Coursera:
The diff tool shows all the differences between any type of file. By highlighting what’s changed, it helps us understand the changes and see how the files have been modified.

While diff is the command that generates the difference between two files, patch is the command that applies those differences to the original file.
To automatically apply changes to a file, we need to run the patch command on the file that we want to modify with the diff file as input.

The git directory acts as a database for all the changes tracked in Git and the working tree acts as a sandbox where we can edit the current versions of the files.
